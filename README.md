# Frontend Mentor Challenges âš¡

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) with the purpose of improving my frontend skills. ðŸŽ¨

## Why I'm Doing This ðŸ’¡

For a long time, I felt stuck in "tutorial hell" and not building my own projects. This repository helps me apply what I've learned and improve my skills. ðŸ’ª

## Challenges by Difficulty (Work in Progress)

At the moment, I havenâ€™t completed any projects yet, but Iâ€™m working on it. ðŸ”¨ðŸ’»

## Future Plans ðŸš€

Last but not least, I'm planning to create an index page to better navigate through the project, like a showcase of all the challenges and solutions. ðŸ‘€
